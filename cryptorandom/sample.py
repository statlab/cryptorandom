    '''
    Random sample of size `size` from a population `a` drawn with or without weights,
    with or without replacement.

    If no weights are provided, the sample is drawn with equal probability of selecting every item.
    If weights are provided, len(weights) must equal N.

    Sampling methods available are:
        * Fisher-Yates:    sampling without weights, without replacement
        * PIKK:            sampling without weights, without replacement
        * recursive:       samping without weights, without replacement
        * Waterman_R:      sampling without weights, without replacement
        * Vitter_Z:        sampling without weights, without replacement
        * sample_by_index: sampling without weights, without replacement
        * Exponential:     sampling with weights, without replacement
        * Elimination:     sampling with weights, without replacement
    
    Fisher-Yates, PIKK, sample_by_index, Exponential, and Elimination return ordered samples, 
    i.e. they are equally likely to return [1, 2] as they are to return [2, 1]. Waterman_R,
    Vitter_Z, and recursive aren't guaranteed to randomize the order of items in the sample.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    a : 1-D array-like or int
        If an array or list, a random sample is generated from its elements.
        If an int, the random sample is generated as if a were np.arange(a)
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., (m, n, k),
        then m * n * k samples are drawn.
        Default is None, in which case a single value is returned.
    replace : boolean, optional
        Whether the sample is with or without replacement.
        Default False.
    fast : boolean, optional
        Whether to speed up sampling by not sampling with random order.
        Default False.
    p : 1-D array-like, optional
        The probabilities associated with each entry in a.
        If not given the sample assumes a uniform distribution over all entries in a.
    method : string
        Which sampling function?
    prng : {None, int, object}
        If prng is None, return a randomly seeded instance of SHA256.
        If prng is an int, return a new SHA256 instance seeded with seed.

def exponential_sample(k, p, prng=None):
    '''
    Weighted random sample of size of size k from 1, ..., n without replacement.

    Let X_1, ..., X_N be independent exponential random variables with rates w_1, ..., w_N,
    and let W = w_1 + ... + w_N.

    Then the chance that X_k is the smallest of them is w_k/W.

    Because of the "memoryless" property of exponential random variables and the independence,
    if the smallest is removed, for j!=k, the chance that X_j is the smallest of the remaining
    variables is w_j/(W-w_k), and so on.

    The percentile function of the exponential distribution with rate w is -ln(1-F)/w.

    Hence, if U~U[0,1], -ln(U)/w ~ exp(w).

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : int
        Desired sample size
    p : 1-D array-like, optional
        The probabilities associated with each value in 1, ... n.
    prng : {None, int, object}
        If prng is None, return a randomly seeded instance of SHA256.
        If prng is an int, return a new SHA256 instance seeded with seed.
        If prng is already a PRNG instance, return it.

    Returns
    -------
    list of items sampled
    '''
    prng = get_prng(prng)
    weights = np.array(p).astype(float) # ensure the weights are floats
    if any(weights < 0):

    if k > n:
        raise ValueError('sample size larger than population in \
            sample without replacement')
