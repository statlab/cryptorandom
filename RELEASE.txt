How to make a new release of ``cryptorandom``
=============================================

- Update release notes.

  1. Review and cleanup ``doc/release/release_dev.txt``

     - To show a list of merges and contributors, run
       ``doc/release/contribs.py <tag of prev release>``.

  2. Rename to ``doc/release/release_X.txt``

  3. Copy ``doc/release/release_template.txt`` to
     ``doc/release/release_dev.txt`` for the next release.

- Update the version number in ``cryptorandom/__init__.py`` by removing the
  ``.dev0`` suffix, commit, and push::

    git add cryptorandom/__init__.py
    git commit -m "Designate <version> release"
    git push <...>

- Update the docs:

  - Build a clean version of the docs.  Run ``pip install .`` in the
    root dir, then ``make clean; make html`` in the docs.
  - Push upstream: ``make github``.

- Add the version number as a tag in git::

   git tag -s cryptorandom-<version> -m 'signed <version> tag'

  (If you do not have a gpg key, use -m instead; it is important for
  Debian packaging that the tags are annotated)

- Push the new meta-data to github::

   git push --tags <...> main

- Review GitHub release page::

   https://github.com/statlab/cryptorandom/releases

- Publish on PyPi::

   git clean -fxd
   python setup.py sdist
   python setup.py bdist_wheel
   twine upload dist/*
   
- On the main branch, update the version number in ``cryptorandom/__init__.py``
  to the next ``.dev0`` version, commit, and push. For example, after the
  ``0.3rc1`` release the version number should be updated to ``0.3rc2.dev0``.

    git add cryptorandom/__init__.py
    git commit -m 'Bump version'
    git push <...>

- Update the development docs for the new version ``0.Xdev`` just like above

- Post release notes on Twitter, mailing lists, etc.
